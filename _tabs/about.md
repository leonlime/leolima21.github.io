<br>
I am a Brazilian, Control and Automation engineer who graduated from Wyden Area 1 and a post-graduate in Robotics and Autonomous Systems from SENAI CIMATEC. Before engineering, I studied Accounting Sciences at the Catholic University of Salvador and Game Design at the School of Art, Game, and Animation (SAGA). I worked as a consultant and auditor at Brand Consultores and also as a programming and game development instructor at Super Geeks. I was a semi-finalist in the AMBEV Sustainability Challenge with the Smart Green House project and I am a Japanese language student at the Nippo-Brazilian Cultural Association of Salvador with an N5 certificate. Currently, my research interests are focused on robotics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. In my spare time, I like to play video games, read comics and watch TV series and movies. 

I created this online portfolio to promote projects and ideas related to robotics or engineering in general.
