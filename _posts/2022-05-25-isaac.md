If you don't know yet, [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim), powered by Omniverse, is a scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool that powers photorealistic, physically-accurate virtual environments to develop, test, and manage AI-based robots.

I have recently started studying this software and i will share my progress with Isaac on this site. I decided to use the [Agilex Scout V2 robot](https://global.agilex.ai/products/scout-2-0) and for this, I imported his original URDF after making minor changes. In this tutorial, I will teach you how to install Isaac Sim and simulate the Scout V2 using ROS2 Foxy.

*PS: This tutorial has been tested on a Ubuntu 20.04 machine, don’t forget to check the [minimum requirements to run Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/requirements.html) and install the correct NVIDIA drivers for your GPU (about this, I’m using the newest [R515 driver and Cuda 11.7](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=20.04&target_type=deb_network)).*

# Installing ROS2 Foxy and Isaac Sim

Just follow the instructions contained in these links below:

- [ROS2 Foxy installation](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)
- [Isaac Sim installation](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/install_basic.html)
- Don't forget to solve this [issue with Isaac Sim Assets](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/known-issue-error-checking-isaac-sim-assets/204522).

### After installation, you need permanently disable ros_bridge and set ros2_bridge by default 
Open the file

```terminal
$ cd ~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2021.2.1/apps/ && gedit omni.isaac.sim.base.kit
```
And at the line 313, replace `"omni.isaac.ros_bridge" = {}` with `"omni.isaac.ros2_bridge" = {}`.

*This is the config file used whenever you start isaac-sim.sh and you can change the startup defaults here.*

### Download my repository for Scout V2
```terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/leonlime/scout_v2_isaac.git
```

# Running the simulation
**Always before opening Isaac Sim**, the first thing to do is start a terminal and source your native ROS2
```terminal
$ source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
```

After this, you can open the `Omniverse Launcher` and launch Isaac sim. If everything is working correctly you will see this screen

On the taskbar click on `File`, `Open` and navigate to the repository folder, find and open the file named `scout_v2_simulation.usd` inside the `Isaac_models` folder. This time, if everything is working correctly you will see...

## Navigating using teleop 
Inside Isaac Sim, just click on the `play` button on the left side to start the simulation and go back to the terminal where you used the `source` command, you can use `ros2 topic list` to check if all things are ok. The result must be like this
```terminal
$ ros2 topic list
/cmd_vel
/odom
/parameter_events
/rosout
/tf
```

To navigate, use the teleop twist command
```terminal
$ ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

And that's all! 

Thanks to use this tutorial and don't forget, if something is wrong you can contact me on my e-mail or Github account.
