According to the NVIDIA description, [this repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_visual_slam) provides a ROS2 package that performs stereo visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) and estimates stereo visual inertial odometry using the Isaac Elbrus GPU-accelerated library. All instructions to use the package are in the README but are focused on docker use. In this tutorial, I will describe an easy way to configure your machine to use the SLAM using Isaac sim and outside a docker.
