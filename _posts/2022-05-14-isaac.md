First you need to install Isaac Sim and ROS2:
nucleus
Second, you need permanently disable ros_bridge and set ros2_bridge by default:

in 

`~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2021.2.1/apps/omni.isaac.sim.base.kit`

at the bottom replace "omni.isaac.ros_bridge" = {} with "omni.isaac.ros2_bridge" = {}

This is the config file used whenever you start isaac-sim.sh and you can change the startup defaults here.
