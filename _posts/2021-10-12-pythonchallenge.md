I recently managed to complete all the 24 challenges on the [Python Principles website](https://pythonprinciples.com/challenges/) and  i decided to share the solutions here in this portfolio for future reference and also to help those who are starting or studying this programming language.

The solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/leonlime/pythonchallenge), in a repository created on my Github.
