This challenge was part of the post-graduation course in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at SENAI CIMATEC. The proposed challenge was to use the Turtlebot robot to perform indoor mapping and thus locate 3 tags scattered in random places on the map. When finding the location of the 3 tags, the robot should navigate between the tag's positions, as if it were monitoring each one of them.
