As I mentioned last time, [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim), powered by Omniverse, is a scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool that powers photorealistic, physically-accurate virtual environments to develop, test, and manage AI-based robots. This post is the part two of Isaac Sim's post series, to read the part one, [click here](/posts/isaac/).

This time I will explain how to simulate a Scout V2 robot with a stereo camera and a 2D LiDAR. You will be able to view the sensors and the odometry on Rviz.

# Simulation setup

First, you need to open the terminal and create a ROS2 workspace
```terminal
$ mkdir -p scout_ws/src
```
go to the src folder and clone the repository
```terminal
$ cd scout_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/leonlime/scout_v2_isaac.git
```
build the package
```terminal
$ cd ..
$ source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
$ colcon build
```
# Running the simulation
Open the terminal, navigate to the workspace you created before and source ROS2. Don't forget, **always before opening Isaac Sim**, the first thing to do is start a terminal and source your native ROS2
```terminal
$ cd scout_ws
$ source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
$ . install/setup.bash
```

Inside the Isaac Sim, open the `scout_v2_simulation.usd` file

Click on the play button on the left panel, go back to the terminal and check the ROS2 topics  
```terminal
$ ros2 topic list
/cmd_vel
/laser_scan
/left/camera_info
/left/rgb
/odom
/parameter_events
/point_cloud
/right/camera_info
/right/rgb
/rosout
/tf
```

To visualize the camera images, LiDAR and odometry, open Rviz
```terminal
$ ros2 launch scout_v2_ros2 scout_v2_rviz.launch.py
```

You can navigate using teleop twist command
```terminal
$ ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

Thanks to use this tutorial and don't forget, if something is wrong you can contact me on my e-mail or Github account.
